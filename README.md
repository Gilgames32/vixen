A playable [Figura](https://github.com/FiguraMC/Figura) avatar for Minecraft.

## Features

> To use the action wheel, hold `B`, click to select and left click to go back.

- Tail physics (real)!
- Custom animations! Too many to list. Watch the trailers!
  - There are some extra animations you can play manually from the action wheel, moving stops the animation.
  - Closed eyes during sleep.
- Hold certain items in the mouth. Tools will also be held in the mouth while spriting. You can modify which items and tools are held in the mouth in `scrips/items.lua`.
- Hold `H` to wag the tail. Also moves the ears a little :3c
- 5 different skins. Can be changed manually from the action wheel.
- Adaptive skin depending on the biome and dimension. Can be enabled from the action wheel.
- Replaces some player sounds with the vanilla fox sound effects.
- Soundboard for the vanilla fox sound effects. Can be played from the action wheel.

Thanks to Rohan for the original idea, model, some animations as well as for helping with the project.

# Plans

While the avatar is mostly done, there are some issues I would like to fix and extras I would like to add. You can see those [here](https://github.com/Gilgames32/vixen/issues).
Ideas are welcome too, but I might not add them.

While this project does not yet include the movement and the world generation seen in Rohan's old videos, there are plans to resurrect those parts too. 
Help would be appreciated.

## Contribution

There is my first time ever working with Figura, BlockBench and Lua. There could be bugs, sluggish animations and plenty of other issues.
Helpful issues and pull requests are welcome. Feel free to contact me if you are more interested in contributing to the avatar or to the rest of the project.
